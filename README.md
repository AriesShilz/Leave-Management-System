# Leave-Management-System
A database management based project using postgresql on leave application for both students and faculty.

ABSTRACT

In the existing Leave Management System, every College/Department follows the manual
procedure in which faculty enters information in a record book. At the end of each
month/session, Administration Department calculates leave(s) of every member which is a time
taking process and there is the chance of losing data or errors in the records.
The projectâ€™s main idea is to develop an online centralized application connected to a database
that can be accessed throughout the organization or a specific group/Dept. This system can be
used to automate the workflow of leave applications and their approvals. The periodic crediting
of leave is also automated. There are features like notifications, cancellation of leave, automatic
approval of leave, report generators etc. Leave Management application will reduce paperwork
and maintain a record in a more efficient and systematic way.
